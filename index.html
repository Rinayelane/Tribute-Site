        <h2>Manata Gandhi</h2>
        <p>
          Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, popularly known as Mahatma Gandhi, is
          regarded as the Father of Nation. Gandhi was a social reformist and
          leader of Indian Independence Movement who introduced the idea of
          non-violent resistance called Satyagrah. Gandhi was born in Gujarat
          and studied law at the Inner Temple, London. After organising a civil
          disobedience movement for Indians living in South Africa, he returned
          to India in 1915. In India, he set out on a train journey to different
          parts of the country trying to understand problems of farmers,
          peasants and urban labourers and organising protests for them. He
          assumbed the leadership of Indian National Congress in 1921 and rose
          to become its most prominent leader and an iconic figure in Indian
          politics. He organised the Dandi Salt March in 1930 and Quit India
          Movement in 1942. He also worked for the upliftment of untouchables
          and have them a new name 'Harijan' meaning the children of God. Gandhi
          also wrote extensively for various newspapers and his symbol of
          self-reliance - the spinning wheel - became a popular symbol of Indian
          Independence Movement. Gandhi played a key role in pacifying people
          and averting the Hindu-Muslim riots as tensions rose before and during
          the partition of the country. He was shot dead by Nathuram Godse on
          January 31, 1948.

        <h2>Struggle for Indian independence (1915â€“1947):</h2>
        <p>
          the request of Gopal Krishna Gokhale, conveyed to him by C. F.
          Andrews, Gandhi returned to India in 1915. He brought an international
          reputation as a leading Indian nationalist, theorist and community
          organiser. Gandhi joined the Indian National Congress and was
          introduced to Indian issues, politics and the Indian people primarily
          by Gokhale. Gokhale was a key leader of the Congress Party best known
          for his restraint and moderation, and his insistence on working inside
          the system. Gandhi took Gokhale's liberal approach based on British
          Whiggish traditions and transformed it to make it look Indian. Gandhi
          took leadership of the Congress in 1920 and began escalating demands
          until on 26 January 1930 the Indian National Congress declared the
          independence of India. The British did not recognise the declaration
          but negotiations ensued, with the Congress taking a role in provincial
          government in the late 1930s. Gandhi and the Congress withdrew their
          support of the Raj when the Viceroy declared war on Germany in
          September 1939 without consultation. Tensions escalated until Gandhi
          demanded immediate independence in 1942 and the British responded by
          imprisoning him and tens of thousands of Congress leaders. Meanwhile,
          the Muslim League did co-operate with Britain and moved, against
          Gandhi's strong opposition, to demands for a totally separate Muslim
          state of Pakistan. In August 1947 the British partitioned the land
          with India and Pakistan each achieving independence on terms that
          Gandhi disapproved.
